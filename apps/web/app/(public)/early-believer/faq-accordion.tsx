    question: "What is the Early Believer Program?",
    answer: (
      <div className="flex flex-col gap-2">
        <p>
          The Early Believer Program is an early-backer initiative for
          supporters who want to directly fund dezign2app&apos;s development. Here
          is exactly how it works:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-1 text-gray-600">
          <li>
            <strong>Current Beta access</strong> — Immediate access to all core
            Beta platform tools &amp; System Design canvas while in Beta.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Automatic Plan Credit Conversion</strong> — As soon as live
            official plans roll out, any remaining balance from your upfront payment
            converts directly into workspace plan credit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lifetime discount (5% or 10%)</strong> — Locks in permanent
            discount savings applied automatically across all official live plans,
            advanced AI features, and cloud deployment bills.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question:
      "How do the 10% ($100K cap) and 5% ($50K cap) discount caps work over time?",
    answer: (
      <div className="flex flex-col gap-2">
        <p>
          Your lifetime discount percentage (10% for the $1,000 tier, 5% for the
          $500 tier) automatically reduces every future recurring invoice for
          your workspace (including annual renewals, additional seat additions,
          and core subscription upgrades).
        </p>
        <p>To maintain fair usage at scale, lifetime savings are capped at:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-1 text-gray-600">
          <li>
            <strong>$1,000 Tier (10% OFF):</strong> Total cumulative discount
            capped at <strong>$100,000 in savings</strong> on your account over
            the years.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>$500 Tier (5% OFF):</strong> Total cumulative discount
            capped at <strong>$50,000 in savings</strong> on your account over
            the years.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once your workspace saves the full capped amount ($100k or $50k),
          standard non-discounted billing resumes automatically.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How do seat quantities and upfront payments work?",
    answer: (
      <div className="flex flex-col gap-2">
        <p>
          You can select anywhere between 1 to 100 seats during checkout. The
          total upfront cost is calculated as{" "}
          <code>Tier Price × Number of Seats</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each seat covers immediate Beta access. When official live pricing
          launches, unused subscription value from your upfront payment is
          credited directly to your workspace seats, and your 5% or 10% lifetime
          discount applies to all ongoing invoices.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question:
      "How does the Beta phase work and will future AI features require a plan upgrade?",
    answer: (
      <div className="flex flex-col gap-2">
        <p>
          dezign2app is currently in Beta with core platform features
          — System Design canvas, architecture tools, and the base platform.
          This is what your Early Believer payment covers right now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Advanced capabilities like{" "}
          <strong>
            AI-assisted system design, automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, and
            cloud services
          </strong>{" "}
          are planned roadmap features. When they roll out, they will have{" "}
          <strong>their own separate pricing tiers</strong> — they are not
          included in current Beta access.
        </p>
        <p>
          The good news: your locked-in 5% or 10% Early Believer discount will
          automatically apply to those future tier subscriptions and add-ons
          when you choose to upgrade.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Can I add more seats later or change my workspace seats?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Yes! You can manage and add seats anytime from your workspace settings.
        Any additional seats added to your workspace in the future will
        automatically receive your locked-in 5% or 10% lifetime discount.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How does the discount cap work if I purchase multiple seats?",
    answer: (
      <div className="flex flex-col gap-2">
        <p>
          The discount cap is allocated per purchased seat. For example, in the
          $1,000 tier (10% OFF), each seat carries a $100,000 cumulative
          discount allowance ($50,000 for the $500 tier).
        </p>
        <p>
          If the lifetime discount savings on your 1st seat are exhausted over
          time, your workspace automatically rolls over to avail the 10%
          discount against your 2nd seat&apos;s discount pool, then your 3rd
          seat, and so on. For instance, purchasing 2 seats at the $1,000 tier
          grants your workspace a total cumulative discount cap of{" "}
          <strong>$200,000</strong>!
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "What capabilities and automation does dezign2app provide?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        dezign2app delivers end-to-end software development automation by
        unifying{" "}
        <strong>
          system architecture design, code generation, automated testing, CI/CD
          pipelines, cloud infrastructure provisioning, real-time monitoring,
          and system maintenance
        </strong>{" "}
        into a single seamless platform.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can lifetime discounts be combined with other promotional codes?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Your Early Believer discount represents our best possible recurring
        workspace rate. While it cannot be stacked on top of limited-time
        seasonal promos, the Early Believer discount applies automatically to
        your standard subscription renewals for years to come.
