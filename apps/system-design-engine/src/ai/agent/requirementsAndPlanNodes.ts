Keep everything from the existing requirements that is still valid — do not drop items the
user didn't contradict. Add whatever new functional/non-functional needs or assumptions the
user just confirmed. Only remove or modify an item if the user explicitly contradicted it.

IMPORTANT — EXCLUDE the following categories entirely; do NOT add them to any field:
- Deployment/hosting details (Docker containers, VM specs, CPU/RAM sizing, managed DB config)
- Operational concerns (health-check endpoints, auto-restart policies, HTTPS termination, load-balancer config, rate-limiting at the edge, backup schedules, read replicas, uptime SLA percentages)

SCALE THE ARCHITECTURE TO THE STATED REQUIREMENTS — this overrides any default instinct
toward a "textbook" or "impressive" design:
- Infer an approximate scale tier from the requirements (e.g. DAU/traffic figures, read/write
  ratio, number of features). If no scale is given, assume small/MVP scale rather than defaulting
  to enterprise-scale patterns.
- For small scale (roughly hundreds to low tens-of-thousands of users, or whenever the
  requirements don't call for independent scaling of separate concerns): prefer a single
  monolithic service over microservices. Only split into multiple services if the
  requirements name distinct domains that need to scale, deploy, or fail independently.
- Only introduce container orchestration (Kubernetes) if the stated scale or requirements
  explicitly justify it (e.g. multi-region, elastic autoscaling, many independently-scaled
  services). Otherwise prefer a single container/VM/managed platform deployment.
- Only introduce a caching layer (Redis, CDN edge cache, etc.) if the requirements name a
  latency target or read volume that a plain database query wouldn't satisfy. Do not add
  caching "just in case."
- Only introduce message brokers/queues if the requirements involve asynchronous processing,
  fan-out, or decoupled services. Do not add messaging infra for a simple synchronous CRUD flow.
- If you are unsure whether a piece of infrastructure is justified by the requirements, leave
  it out rather than including it for completeness.

FORMAT — this is as important as the content:
- Target 200-400 words total. Hard cap 500.
- Use bullet points. You may use sub-bullets (up to two levels deep) to detail schemas and fields.
- No "why not X / alternatives considered" discussion, no generic explanations of what a
  pattern or technology is. State the choice, not the reasoning essay behind it.
- Skip any section that isn't needed for these requirements entirely (e.g. no caching
  section if nothing warrants a cache).
- Name real, specific technologies (e.g. "PostgreSQL", "Kafka"), never vague terms like
  "a suitable database".

CONTENT — cover only what applies, each as terse bullets:
- **Architecture**: one line naming the pattern (monolith/microservices/serverless/event-driven).
- **Services**: one line per service — name, tech stack, one-clause responsibility, 2-4
  representative endpoints as "METHOD /path".
- **Data storage & Schemas**: one line per store — engine + what it holds. CRITICAL: Include sub-bullets detailing the specific schemas (tables/entities/collections) and their key fields needed to satisfy the functional requirements. These will be modeled as Entity nodes.
- **Messaging** (only if needed): one line — which broker + what flows through it. Mention key event schemas/payloads.
- **Caching** (only if needed): one line — what's cached.
- **Client**: one line — framework + how it talks to the backend.

CRITICAL: Do NOT include a deployment plan, hosting details, or infrastructure operations in the architecture plan. Focus strictly on software architecture (services, schemas, APIs, brokers).

End with a single short line asking the user to approve or say what to change. Do not
restate the requirements back to them.`,
